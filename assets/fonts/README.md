# Fonts Directory

Please place your **Fendysa.ttf** font file in this directory.

The app is currently configured to use this font for the "Jawara" wordmark in the splash screen.

If you don't have the Fendysa font, you can:

1. Download it and place it here as `Fendysa.ttf`, or
2. Comment out the `fontFamily: 'Fendysa'` line in `lib/splash_page.dart` to use the default font
